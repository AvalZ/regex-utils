# Regex Utils
A set of utils to work with Regular Expressions in Python

## Main Features
- Generate strings that match a given regex
- Intersect two regular expressions
- Negate a regular expression (experimental)
- Convert a NFA back into a regex

Use Python native `sre_parse` to parse a regex, then convert it into a [Nondeterministic Finite Automaton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nondeterministic_finite_automaton)

Once you have this NFA, you can perform 

## String Generation

Generate strings that match the given regex, by performing a random walk over the generated NFA

## Intersection

Intersect two regular expressions.

This is the equivalent of having to match both regex, one after the other. The advantage is that you can now use the `to_string` function to generate the resulting regular expression.

This is also useful if you want to ‚Äúcompile‚Äù lookarounds into the regex itself.

## Negation (experimental)

Complement the original NFA by converting accepting states to non-accepting states, and add all missing transitions (this is used to generate random strings). The logic is similar to a Negative Lookahead in PCRE.

WARNING: this feature is currently experimental, and it contains some known bugs for specific scenarios.

Please open a issue if you find any specific bugs related to this feature üôè

## NFA to Regex

Once you have the resulting NFA, you can get the original regex back in plain text, so that you can use it in other tools.
